### Securing the Wireless Philadelphia Network

**Sponsor:**  National Science Foundation (NSF)


The goal of this project is to enhance security in large municipal networks by enhancing the security of the network and the hosts that compose the network. The project consists of three primary tasks:

* State measurement and aggregation techniques for local network anomaly detection, using distributed source coding and compressive sampling.
* Physical layer security for municipal wireless networks, using physical layer encryption key generation and authentication.
* Host based anomaly detection, using various detection and machine learning techniques.

My focus is primarily on the host-based anomaly detection component.

### Anomaly Detection to Support FAA NextGen
**Sponsor:** Federal Aviation Administration

The goal of this effort was to support verification and validation of new aviation technologies through the analysis of large, multi-dimensional datasets.

### CREW Network Centric Operations
**Sponsor:** U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC)

The CREW (Counter-RCIED Electronic Warfare) Network Centric Operations project's objective was to develop algorithms and techniques to detect sequences of events in RF features.
Techniques were developed to extract RF features under time windowing constraints, and algorithms were developed to detect patterns in these feature sets.
My focus was on systems integration: I created a working prototype system in MATLAB that interfaced with the MSDD 3000 RF digitizer and performed detection using profile hidden Markov models.

### SAPIENT
**Sponsor:** Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Labs (ATL) and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

The objective of this project was to evaluate solutions for reliable communication in highly constrained networks, considering bandwidth, latency, loss, and connectivity constraints.  Such networks include satellite, tactical radio, WiFi, and WiMax networks. We evaluated methods using Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) to improve communication in such networks.

### RE-Detector
**Sponsor:** Lockheed Martin, Maritime Systems and Sensors

Performed a comprehensive evaluation of various software reverse engineering tools and developed a software system for detecting the presence and use of reverse engineering tools.
