abstract={The complex computing systems employed by governments, corporations, and other institutions are frequently targeted by cyber-attacks designed for espionage and sabotage. The malicious software used in such attacks are typically custom-designed or obfuscated to avoid detection by traditional antivirus software. Our goal is to create a malware detection system that can quickly and accurately detect such otherwise difficult-to-detect malware. We pose the problem of malware detection as a multi-channel change-point detection problem, wherein the goal is to identify the point in time when a system changes from a known clean state to an infected state. We present a host-based malware detection system designed to run at the hypervisor level, monitoring hypervisor and guest operating system sensors and sequentially determining whether the host is infected. We present a case study wherein the detection system is used to detect various types of malware on an active web server under heavy computational load.},

abstract={Malware authors are increasingly using specialized toolkits and obfuscation techniques to modify existing malware and avoid detection by traditional antivirus software. The resulting proliferation of obfuscated malware variants poses a challenge to antivirus vendors, who must create signatures to detect each new malware variant. Although the many variants in a malware family have different static signatures, they share characteristic behavioral patterns resulting from their common function and heritage. We describe an automatic classification system that can be trained to accurately identify new variants within known malware families, using observed similarities in behavioral features extracted from sensors monitoring live computers hosts. We evaluate the accuracy of the classifier on a live testbed under a heavy computational load. The described classification system is intended to perform classification online, using the computed classes of newly detected malware variants to guide the automatic mitigation of infected hosts.},
