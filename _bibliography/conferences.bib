abstract={This paper surveys malicious cloud service use and considers both the underlying motivation and the likelihood of increased adoption by attackers. We look to market research to assess cloud adoption trends since the launch of Amazon Web Services, and summarize related academic literature about using software-as-a-service to drive botnets and infrastructure-as-a-service as malware command and control. We consider how cloud adoption trends enable attackers to conduct more successful campaigns, evading detection by blending in with day-to-day business traffic. In particular, we detail detection challenges associated with using the cloud for phishing, command and control, and data exfiltration. We further explore how the cloud enables attackers to bypass common technical controls. It is hoped that this paper will provide a warning about how attackers continously evolve to evade current detection methods, particularly how their movement to the cloud poses immediate challenges. The goal is to inspire careful consideration of the potential impact that malware using legitimate cloud applications for malicious purposes will have on the threat landscape.},

abstract={This study presents a malware classification system designed to classify malicious processes at run-time on production hosts. The system monitors process-level system call activity and uses information extracted from system call traces as inputs to the classifier. The system is advantageous because it does not require the use of specialized analysis environments. Instead, a `lightweight' service application monitors process execution and classifies new malware samples based on their behavioral similarity to known malware. This study compares the effectiveness of multiple feature sets, ground truth labeling schemes, and machine learning algorithms for malware classification. The accuracy of the classification system is evaluated against processlevel system call traces of recently discovered malware samples collected from production environments. Experimental results indicate that accurate classification results can be achieved using relatively short system call traces and simple representations.},

abstract={System call analysis is a behavioral malware detection technique that is popular due to its promising detection results and ease of implementation. This study describes a system that uses system call analysis to detect malware that evade traditional defenses. The system monitors executing processes to identify compromised hosts in production environments. Experimental results compare the effectiveness of multiple feature extraction strategies and detectors based on their detection accuracy at low false positive rates. Logistic regression and support vector machines consistently outperform log-likelihood ratio and signature detectors as processing and detection methods. A feature selection study indicates that a relatively small set of system call 3-grams provide detection accuracy comparable to that of more complex models. A case study indicates that the detection system performs well against a variety of malware samples, benign workloads, and host configurations.}

abstract={The complex computing systems employed by governments, corporations, and other institutions are frequently targeted by cyber-attacks designed for espionage and sabotage. The malicious software used in such attacks are typically custom-designed or obfuscated to avoid detection by traditional antivirus software. Our goal is to create a malware detection system that can quickly and accurately detect such otherwise difficult-to-detect malware. We pose the problem of malware detection as a multi-channel change-point detection problem, wherein the goal is to identify the point in time when a system changes from a known clean state to an infected state. We present a host-based malware detection system designed to run at the hypervisor level, monitoring hypervisor and guest operating system sensors and sequentially determining whether the host is infected. We present a case study wherein the detection system is used to detect various types of malware on an active web server under heavy computational load.},

abstract={Malware authors are increasingly using specialized toolkits and obfuscation techniques to modify existing malware and avoid detection by traditional antivirus software. The resulting proliferation of obfuscated malware variants poses a challenge to antivirus vendors, who must create signatures to detect each new malware variant. Although the many variants in a malware family have different static signatures, they share characteristic behavioral patterns resulting from their common function and heritage. We describe an automatic classification system that can be trained to accurately identify new variants within known malware families, using observed similarities in behavioral features extracted from sensors monitoring live computers hosts. We evaluate the accuracy of the classifier on a live testbed under a heavy computational load. The described classification system is intended to perform classification online, using the computed classes of newly detected malware variants to guide the automatic mitigation of infected hosts.},
