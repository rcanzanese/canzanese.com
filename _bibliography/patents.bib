 abstract = { A method for operating a binary executable in which some of the data or code is to be protected includes the step of pruning the binary executable of the code andor data to be protected. Nonfunctional code is substituted for the code pruned from the binary executable, to form a pruned executable which does not contain the code to be protected. The code pruned from the binary executable is loaded into a code injection service or program (CIS). The binary executable is placed in memory as with any application. Invoking the pruned executable alone results in crash. The CIS is made part of the operating system service, and is loaded into RAM when the computer starts. When the pruned executable is invoked, the CIS detects its presence, and as the pruned executable runs, the CIS substitutes the actual data or code into the pruned executable, whereby it operates normally.
